(Please Note: This script & dashboard is built for my data analytics portfolio and does not serve the real data. It cannot be used for decision-making.)

## Context
In this project, I extract data provided in the Keyword Creative Center and use scraping methodology & exploratory analysis to understand the ad network better. After manipulation of extracted data, I created a dashboard to give a snapshot of network performance in different breakdowns such as country & genre.
